# Online Shop For Storehouse
## Holidays edition))

I am an owner of storehouse that sells various holiday merchandise. I have a very busi time before holidays, for example, Christmas and I have trouble writing down all incoming orders. So I've desided to write a simple app that would keep track of the orders, add numbers of ordered goods to googlesheets and  add all the numbers in the end of the market day.
